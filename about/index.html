        <h3>Ever wanted to own a plaza?</h3>
        <p>While PlazaNet has it's official instance, the magic doesn’t stop there. Because it's fully self‑hostable, you can spin up your own Linux* server and create a private plaza just for friends, family, or any other group you can think of.</p>
    <h6>* – PlazaNet is written in Python and works on any system that can run it, but development and the official deployment both happen on Linux.</h6>
